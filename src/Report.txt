Abstract:


    The goal of this project is to create an engaging game that challenges the player to explore
different cities and fight robbers along the way. The player will control an elf character 
and navigate through a map with different cities marked. An AI player will be programmed 
in Python to play through the game like the player would. 
    The game will be developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. 
The player will be able to use the number pad to move the elf to the different cities. The player
will not be able to move from one city to another however unless there is an existing route.
Everytime the player moves from one city to another there is a random chance that they encounter
a robber. If there are robbers on the route, the player will engage in a battle with them.
    The AI player will be implemented using reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The system will match the player's actions to move through different cities and fight robbers.
There will also be an element of cost in the game, if the player does not have enough money 
to travel to a city then he will not be able to travel to the city. The player will also have
to pay attention to the health as when they are fighting and they take hits their health will
decrease by 10.  
    Different AI techniques were implemented into the game to model how a real player would play.
How the player moves, the combat they engage in, and the cost to travel between cities is all 
determinant on the AI techniques.
