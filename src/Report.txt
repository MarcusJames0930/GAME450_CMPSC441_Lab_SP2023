Abstract:
    The goal of this project is to create an engaging game that challenges the player to explore
different cities and fight robbers along the way. The player will control an elf character 
and navigate through a map with different cities marked. An AI player will be programmed 
in Python to play through the game like the player would. 
    The game will be developed using Pygame, a popular Python library for game development. 
The player will be able to use the number pad to move the elf to the different cities. The player
will not be able to move from one city to another however unless there is an existing route.
Everytime the player moves from one city to another there is a random chance that they encounter
a robber. If there are robbers on the route, the player will engage in a battle with them.
    The AI player will be implemented using reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The system will match the player's actions to move through different cities and fight robbers.
There will also be an element of cost in the game, if the player does not have enough money 
to travel to a city then he will not be able to travel to the city. The player will also have
to pay attention to the health as when they are fighting and they take hits their health will
decrease by 10.  
    Different AI techniques were implemented into the game to model how a real player would play.
How the player moves, the combat they engage in, and the cost to travel between cities is all 
determinant on the AI techniques. 


AI components:
1. AI Player movement 
2. AI Player combat 
3. ..


Problems Solved:
    For the AI Player movement the random function within Python was utilized along with some 
conditions based on the crieria of the game. In the game the player can use the number keys 
0-9 to move the player from one city to another. For the AI Player to select what city they 
move to an random function was coded to return a value between 0 and 9. However for the game
the player can only move between cities where there is an existing path. So for the project 
a checking system had to be implemented when the AI Player selects this number. If there is 
no existing path between the cities that they try to travel to then they have to select 
another option. 
    For the AI Player combat the random function within Python was utilized with selections 
for the different weapons that the player can use in the game. The player can select a,s or f 
to utilize weapons in the game those being arrow, sword and fire respectively. The nature of the
combat is like rock-paper-scissors such that the AI Player and computer both select weapons at
the same time and depending on which on is selected, one weapon will beat the other or there 
will be a tie.
